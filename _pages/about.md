My name is Ruiqi Feng. I am currently a PhD student in the Engineering School of Westlake University, advised by [Prof. Tailin Wu](https://tailin.org/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics, as well as other natural sciences.

In the spring of 2023, I was an exchange student at NC State University where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaorui Liu](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/xiaorui/).
Prior to that, I was an undergraduate in the physics department at Fudan University, mentored by [Prof. Lei Shi](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=Tm6iemoAAAAJ&hl=es).

<!-- Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7yE7WQQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [CV](/files/resume.pdf).
